## development

## 0.3.0

- Runtime asynchronous errors can now be caught and full call stack shown.
  Previously only errors that were a direct response to evaluated text were shown.

- Objects in callstacks have â–¶ icons. Click to unfold a full variable
  dump of each object. Very useful for debugging.

- Growl notifications on error (optional)
  see for install instructions if you need growl:
  https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl
  ox x / linux / windows
  Very useful if you are busy making music in another window and want to know why the music just stopped.

- Server errors are colorized (eg. Node/SynthDef not found)


## 0.2.0

- Using new supercollider.js, displays a full call stack for errors
- Displays library compilation errors
- Highlights syntax and compile errors
- Brief styling flash on evaluated text with error/success colorization
- Click to navigate to errors, files, and methods
- sets nowExecutingPath correctly for sc scripts that depend on this
- Improved management of sclang's state (compile, compile error, booting)
- Enable copy from post window

## 0.1.2

Fixed 3.6.6 repl issues. Some sclang versions seem to need stripping all \n and always appending a \n at the end of the command

Fixed evaluate current line if nothing is selected

- REPL
  + works very well with 3.7
  + 3.6.6 is a bit janky
