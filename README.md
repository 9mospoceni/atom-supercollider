# SuperCollider for Atom

A SuperCollider development environment for Atom.io

SuperCollider is a programming language and for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

This is an alternative to the standard IDE. There are also development environments for Emacs and VIM.

There is a cross platform IDE (OS X/Linux/Windows) which communicates with the language interpreter and via Open Sound Control (OSC) with one or more synthesis servers.

The language interpreter runs in a separate process (sclang) and has full support for Qt based GUIs.

The SuperCollider synthesis server (scsynth) runs in a separate process or even on a separate machine so it is ideal for realtime networked music.
